              title: "Large scale fabrication of HX biphilic surfaces",
              dateRange: "October 2022 - June 2023",
              summary: `At the Energy Transport Research Lab at the University of Illinois I am developing a large scale fabrication method for biphilic surfaces. I am working with graduate student Majid Linjawi, under the PI Professor Nenad Milijkovic.
        
              Biphilic surfaces are both hydrophobic and hydrophilic, and can be used as the stock material for heat exchangers.  Currently heat exchangers are made of standard aluminum alloys.  When used in heat pump applications, stock aluminum forms ice rapidly, and the cycle needs to be either run in reverse or heated externally to completely deice the exchanger, which decreases efficiency.  
              
              Because biphilic surfaces are hydrophobic and hydrophilic the surface allows ices to move as a slush before it is entirely liquid.  This requires less energy input for deicing, ultimately increasing the energy efficiency of the cycle. 
              
              Currently, biphilic surfaces are only made on a small scale in labs.  In this project, I am designing a scalable manufacturing assembly for biphilic surfaces.  The purpose of the assembly is to make a roll of aluminum stock into a roll of biphilic aluminum. The fabrication assembly will use a conveyer system for ultrasonic cleaning, boemitization, and hydrophobic coating, which will create a hydrophilic and hydrophobic material that can be tested for efficiency.

              dateRange: "October 2022 - Janurary 2023",
              summary: `Tunneled is a collaborative project with my good friend and artist Conrad Edmonds that combines my engineering skills and his art skills. My main focus was to find an elegant and impactful way to make Edmond's 2D art 3D. Our inspiration for this project stemmed from Disney's film making methods from the 20th century, where layers of cutouts and paintings were stacked to create depth for 2-dimensional television.  Working in reverse, we were able to make Edmonds art, the design in the first picture, have 3 dimensions by stacking specific-colored layers.  The layers and box are laser cut acrylic, and by painting the layers and adding light inside the box, the layers worked together to convey Edmonds art in 3D as seen in the bottom right.

              summary: `As a bicycle enthusiast, I wanted to design an aesthetically pleasing part while while maintaining or improving on functionality, especially since bike parts have mostly remained stagnant for decades.
        
              The bike stem is virtually the same design on all bikes no matter the brand. Striving for aesthetics, I designed a bike stem with a unique shape and pattern. I created the first two prototypes before learning about manufacturing; however, I am currently working on a revision of this project that lowers manufacturing costs based on the drawing in the third image.`,
