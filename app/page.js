  const introText=`  My name is George Penn, and I am happy to share with you insight about
  me and some of my most recent projects. I am a Chicago native and a
  graduating senior at the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign
  studying mechanical engineering. Engineering and design have always
  been my passion. My fascination with engineering grew in highschool
  when I started biking and learning how to put together bikes, and
  shortly later in product design when I was introduced to TinkerCAD.
  Now in college, I've developed concrete skills in design, learning to
  use CAD programs efficiently, tolerance parts, and design projects
  based on manufacturing methods. I have implemented this knowledge
  working on self-led projects, group school projects, collaborative
  projects with friends, and research projects. Recently, I have also
  been able to explore other areas of engineering besides mechanical,
  working on web development. This started near the start of 2023, when
  I needed a quick way to create citations for my academic papers. There
  are many websites which attempt to do this but not in a way which is
  suitable. I saw a need and I started developing a next.js website.
  Since then I have been able to learn javascript and the node js
  environment, which helped me create the citation website, and this
  website.`
